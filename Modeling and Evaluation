This section outlines the machine learning models employed, their training methodology, performance evaluation, and key findings for predicting in-hospital mortality using the preprocessed MIMIC-III dataset. The aim is to identify effective models and critical factors influencing patient outcomes.
The superior performance of the Random Forest model suggests that patient outcomes are influenced by intricate, non-linear interactions among demographic, clinical, and procedural factors. The carefully engineered features, which capture aspects of patient care intensity and complexity, significantly contributed to the model's accuracy, underscoring the vital role of comprehensive feature engineering in clinical predictive modeling.

While the Random Forest offers enhanced accuracy, the interpretability of Logistic Regression remains valuable for deriving clinical insights and ensuring transparency in decision-making. A combined approach, leveraging the strengths of both models, could further enhance the applicability and trustworthiness of predictive models in healthcare settings.
