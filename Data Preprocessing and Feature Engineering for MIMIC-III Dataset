ICU Mortality Prediction – Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

This repository contains the data preprocessing pipeline and feature engineering strategies applied to the `mimic3c.csv` dataset—a structured, curated subset of the MIMIC-III dataset aimed at predicting hospital mortality for ICU patients.
This project focuses on the comprehensive preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline for the MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) dataset. The goal is to transform raw clinical data into a clean, normalized, and feature-rich dataset suitable for predictive modeling tasks, particularly for predicting hospital mortality.
