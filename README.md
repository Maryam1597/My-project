ICU Patient Outcome Prediction Using MIMIC-III Classifier Dataset

This project utilizes a curated version of the MIMIC-III dataset (`mimic3c.csv`) to predict clinical outcomes—specifically in-hospital mortality—of ICU patients using machine learning techniques.
ataset Overview

The dataset is a structured, preprocessed extract of the MIMIC-III database, made publicly available via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) by Dr. Scarlat (@drscarlat). It includes rich, aggregated patient-level data from over 40,000 critical care patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.
